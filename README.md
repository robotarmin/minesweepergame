This is just me learning how to build a basic android app. I named the repo minesweeper, but it will be a long time to get to that level. Now I am just figuring out the usage of Android Studio, and learning how to use Github properly too.<br>
from the prevous repo (lol):

>my first android app (it will probably be a minesweeper game) I will create a sort of tutorial here as I scrape various online sources about building an app.
The best idea is to probably start with this tutorial: https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-first-app
As I am doing this whole project for the Github Arcade thing I will not strictly follow the tutorial/I will try to make it my own thing somehow.
Installation takes some time, in which I will update this file with things like: I use OpenSUSE Tumbleweed right now so this whole project thing will be done on linux. I honestly do not think Android Studio for Linux differs much from the Windows or Mac edition.
And as a start I simply cannot figure out where to find the Design tab to actually see what my example application looks like:( nvm I got it after tweaking the settings a bit and looking up on stackoverflow ACCIDENTALLY CREATED ANOTHER REPO. WHATEVER.

The app is now in its stopwatch phase. I copied the stopwatch code from the tutorial website, I only played around with the layout, and created a new button that opens this repo in the default browser. I would like to play around with Java too in the future, but first I want to understand how the layout works.
